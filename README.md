# Centivo API ‚Äì Node.js + MongoDB

## üß† Approach

This project implements a RESTful API using Node.js and Express, backed by MongoDB Atlas for data persistence. The logic retrieves a user by their unique ID and conditionally returns the data only if the user's age is greater than 21. The app uses Mongoose for schema modeling and `.env` configuration for clean, environment-specific settings.
